# Custom Email Generator Application

## Overview

This project demonstrates a custom email application developed using Meta's LLaMA 3.1 and Groq for faster inference. The application automates the process of generating cold emails tailored to specific job postings. By inputting a job URL, the application extracts the job description and required skill set using the LangChain WebLoader framework, preprocesses the data, and utilizes an LLM to generate a personalized email. The application also leverages ChromaDB for semantic search, enabling the LLM to fetch relevant links related to the required skills, thereby showcasing proficiency in the generated email.

## Business Use Case

The primary business use case for this application is to automate the process of acquiring clients for service-based companies through cold emailing. The application streamlines the process by extracting relevant job details and generating professional emails that demonstrate expertise and interest in the role.

## Tech Stack

- **Generative AI**
- **LLM (Large Language Model)**
- **Prompt Engineering**
- **LangChain WebLoader**
- **ChromaDB for Semantic Search**
- **Groq** for Faster Inference

## How It Works

1. **Input**: The user provides the URL of a job posting.
2. **Text Extraction**: Using the LangChain WebLoader framework, the text from the job posting is extracted.
3. **Preprocessing**: The extracted text is cleaned and prepared for the LLM.
4. **Job and Skill Extraction**: The preprocessed text is passed to the LLM with a custom prompt to extract the job description and required skill set.
5. **Semantic Search**: ChromaDB is used as a vector database to perform semantic search, allowing the LLM to fetch relevant links related to the required skills.
6. **Email Generation**: The LLM generates a personalized cold email demonstrating the applicant's expertise and interest in the job.

## Conclusion

This application is a powerful tool for automating the process of generating personalized cold emails, which can significantly enhance the efficiency of acquiring clients for service-based companies.
